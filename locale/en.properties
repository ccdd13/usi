help_1_description = In many cases, the Userscript won't run directly in USI, bacause USI and GM are handling the @run-at statement slightly different \n\
often it is enough to switch this, that means if the GM Userscript has "@run-at document-start" defined, then you have to switch it to "@run-at document-ready" for USI
help_2_title = Why did I not have access to the "document"?
help_2_description = Like in the other case, the reason is the "@run-at" statement, \n\
if it is defined as "document-start", there is no complete "document" at the time your Userscript runs, this will be available with "document-ready". \n\
